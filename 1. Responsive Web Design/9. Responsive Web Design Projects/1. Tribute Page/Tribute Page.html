        <h2 id="heading">Brief Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            <p id="intro">Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
               His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm.
               In 1863 Tesla’s brother Daniel was killed in a riding accident.
               The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old Tesla, who reported seeing visions—the first signs of his lifelong mental illnesses.

        <h2 id="subheading">Time line of Nikola Tesla's life</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1856</strong> - Born in Smiljan </li>
            <li><strong>1875</strong> - Tesla Enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic</li>
            <li><strong>1882</strong> - Worked for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical equipment sent from the United States</li>
            <li><strong>1882</strong> - Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used today in alternators</li>
            <li><strong>1884</strong> - Moved to United States</li>
            <li><strong>1886</strong> - Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey.
                                        He invented and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment</li>
            <li><strong>1891</strong> - Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage,
                                        low current and high frequency alternating current electricity</li>
            <li><strong>1901</strong> - Construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly,
                                        and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed</li>
            <li><strong>1934</strong> - New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community</li>
            <li><strong>1943</strong> - On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research</li>
